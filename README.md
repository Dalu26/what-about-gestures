What about Gestures is a Youtube Playlist where I like to share the process of creating React Native animations. All animations are always made from scratch trying to make them easy to understand.

The basis of all animations are always the following packages:

- [react-native-gesture-handler](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs)
- [react-native-reanimated v2](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/)

Sounds interesting? [Click here!](https://youtu.be/xpT2shjX790)
